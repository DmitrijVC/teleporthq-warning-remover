# TWR
A simple script that hides warning about unsupported browser on Firefox for TeleportHQ.

# Idea
Support for Firefox by the TeleportHQ team has been discontinued due to some issues with the browser.

However, some users wish to use the Firefox regardless.

This script will automatically hide the overlay warning allowing you to still use the editor on Firefox.

# How to use

### 1. Manually
Simply copy-paste the code from `js/script.js` into a console whenever you see the overlay.

### 2. Automatically
- Install the Tampermonkey extension. [[homepage]](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php) [[addon]](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey)
- Create a new script.
- Copy-paste the code from `js/script.js` into the editor.
- Save the script.

No further steps are required. The script should be run automatically every time you visit the TeleportHQ.
